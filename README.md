## UI for the Oregon Walks Curb Ramp Survey App


### Contributors

Primary development by Scott Parker (@jscottparker).  Testing and other support by 
Katie Urey (@rbracket) and Peter W (@techieshark).

## Roadmap

After this app is tested, we'll use it to collect data and feed that into a pedestrian 
and wheelchair routing application (probably powered by [Open Trip Planner](http://opentripplanner.com/demos)).

### History

Mele Sax-Barnett (pdxmele) developed the first application and it can be
found at her github repository.
