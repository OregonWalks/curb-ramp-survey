## This is the new UI for the Oregon Walks Curb Ramp Inventory App

Mele Sax-Barnett (pdxmele) developed the first application and it can be
found at her github repository.

The code here while is a revision as Scott Parker continues development 
on the application.

Katie Urey (rbracket) is hosting this on github for now as we prepare
for testing.
